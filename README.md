Stretch Goals:
- Payment System Integration
- Notifications & Direct Messages
- Modify rating system
- Watchlist for items you are interested in purchasing.   
- Allow Users to remove themselves from the group and from the global view.  
- Private Groups
- Advertising
- Allow Image and Image Storage

Work we would have done differently
- Work more hours
- Not had changed the groupId on the <code> viewGroup.do?</code> method
- Could of had a background video, but, the videos were not suitable.

Things we like:
- Everything works as intended for the first Sprint
- Room to grow the site

Things we don't like:
- Lack of color on the front-end
- Log out bug (does not consistently log out)
- Did not implement a way for users remove themselves from a group
